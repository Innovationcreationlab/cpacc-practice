# Practice Questions for the Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC) Exam

This is a repository for sharing practice questions in [GIFT Format](https://docs.moodle.org/37/en/GIFT_format) for the [Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/cpacccertification) Exam.  _This is not an official resource of the [International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP).](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org)_ 

## Note changes in formatting and numbering
Please note that the original [Body of Knowledge (BOK) document](https://iaap.membershipsoftware.org/files/IAAP%20CPACC%20BOK%202017_062317.docx) has some formatting errors and they are not consistent in how or whether they communicate what they are calling _Study Tasks_.  Since I'm viewing these _Study Tasks_ as what are called learning objectives in standard instructional design parlance, and I want to be able to clearly associate these objectives with their respective assessments, I've corrected numbering errors and changed bulleted lists into numbered list items for the _Study Tasks_,  Therefore, when referencing a _Study Task_ in your question, refer to the structre and numbering system I have in this repository.  So, for instance, in Section I:E on Disability Etqiuette, there are two numbered _Study Tasks_.  If your question was for the second study task listed there, you would reference it as **I:E.2 Judge the appropriateness of various ways of referring to or about people with disabilities**. 

In some instances, there were no _Study Tasks_ listed for a particular module in the BOK.  I've begun inferring what I think the intended study tasks were intended to be, and, in those instances, I've added them.  However, for some, I haven't yet had time to do this.  If you want to add questions for a module that doesn't yet have _Study Tasks_ listed, please do so.  Just reference the module number in your question.  For instance, currently, there are no _Study Tasks_ for Module II:D, so you'd just reference the module as a whole, like so: **Module II:D Accessibility Principles for ICT (WCAG 2.0)**.

To see how I've numbered things specifically, just dig into the relevant sections from this index page.  

A new edition of the CPACC BOK should be coming soon and, assuming they have fixed the problems in the Body of Knowledge, I will reformat things to match how IAAP has chosen to do it.
