## 1.	Medical Model
### Definition of the Medical Model:

From Disabled World:
>The medical model is presented as viewing disability as a problem of the person, directly caused by disease, trauma, or other health condition which therefore requires sustained medical care provided in the form of individual treatment by professionals. In the medical model, management of the disability is aimed at a "cure," or the individual’s adjustment and behavioral change that would lead to an "almost-cure" or effective cure. In the medical model, medical care is viewed as the main issue, and at the political level, the principal response is that of modifying or reforming health care policy.
Disabled World: [Disability Models](https://www.disabled-world.com/definitions/disability-models.php)

From Wikipedia:
>The medical model of disability is a sociopolitical model by which illness or disability, being the result of a physical condition intrinsic to the individual (it is part of that individual’s own body), may reduce the individual's quality of life, and cause clear disadvantages to the individual. The medical model tends to believe that curing or at least managing illness or disability mostly or completely revolves around identifying the illness or disability from an in-depth clinical perspective (in the sense of the scientific understanding undertaken by trained healthcare providers), understanding it, and learning to control and/or alter its
course. By extension, the medical model also believes that a "compassionate" or just society invests resources in health care and related services in an attempt to cure disabilities medically, to expand functionality and/or improve functioning, and to allow disabled persons a more "normal" life. The medical profession's responsibility and potential in this area is seen as central.
Wikipedia: [Medical model of disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_model_of_disability)

### Strengths of the Medical Model:

The medical model can address the biological sources of disabilities, either by clinically curing them or providing ways to medically manage the conditions. The medical component of disabilities is a critical reality for many people.

### Weaknesses of the Medical Model:

The medical model treats disability as a "problem" or inherent characteristic of the individual, and seeks cures or medical management of a bodily condition, often overlooking the broader sociopolitical constraints imposed by unwelcoming or inaccessible environments.

## 2.	Social Model
### Definition of the Social Model:

From Disabled World:
>The social model of disability sees the issue of "disability" as a socially created problem and a matter of the full integration of individuals into society. In this model, disability is not an attribute of an individual, but rather a complex collection of conditions, many of which are created by the social environment. Hence, the management of the problem requires social action and is the collective responsibility of society at large to make the environmental modifications necessary for the full participation of people with disabilities in all areas of social life. The issue is both cultural and ideological, requiring individual, community, and large-scale social change. From this perspective, equal access for someone with an impairment/disability is a human rights issue of major concern.
Disabled World: [Disability Models](https://www.disabled-world.com/definitions/disability-models.php)
 
From Wikipedia:
>The social model of disability is a reaction to the dominant medical model of disability which in itself is a functional analysis of the body as machine to be fixed in order to conform with normative values. The social model of disability identifies systemic barriers, negative attitudes and exclusion by society (purposely or inadvertently) that mean society is the main contributory factor in disabling people. While physical, sensory, intellectual, or psychological variations may cause individual functional limitation or impairments, these do not have to lead to disability unless society fails to take account of and include people regardless of their individual differences. The origins of the approach can be traced to the 1960s; the specific term emerged from the United Kingdom in the 1980s.
The social model of disability has come to be one of the most prevalent approaches to disability, and has become somewhat of a rallying cry for disability advocates from a social justice perspective.
Wikipedia: [Social model of disability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_model_of_disability)

### Strengths of the Social Model:

The social model's focus on the disabling conditions in the environment and in society makes it clear that the barriers and challenges experienced by people with disabilities are not inevitable, nor are they exclusively a characteristic of the individual's "broken" body. Societies can improve the lives of people with disabilities considerably by ensuring that the world around us is designed to accommodate a wide range of human characteristics and abilities.

### Weaknesses of the Social Model:

The social model of disability can tend to downplay the embodied aspects of disabilities too much, as if disability had nothing to do with bodily characteristics at all. The social model's push for social justice in the political arena can also put activists at odds with people with other political interests, antagonizing relationships and sometimes creating resolute political adversaries.

## 3.	Economic Model
### Definition of the Economic Model:

From Disabled World:
>Defines disability by a person’s inability to participate in work. It also assesses the degree to which impairment affects an individual’s productivity and the economic consequences for the individual, employer and the state. Such consequences include loss of earnings for and payment for assistance by the individual; lower profit margins for the employer; and state welfare payments. This model is directly related to the charity/tragedy model.
Disabled World: [Disability Models](https://www.disabled-world.com/definitions/disability-models.php)

### Strengths of the Economic Model:
The economic model recognizes the effect of bodily limitations on a person’s ability to work, and there may be a need for economic support and/or accommodations for the person’s disability.

### Weaknesses of the Economic Model:
The economic model creates a legally-defined category of people who are “needy,” which can be stigmatizing for people with disabilities. Also, if a person doesn’t meet the legal threshold for “disabled,” or if there is a dispute as to a person’s disability, the person with the disability may not receive the support they need.

## 4.	Functional Solutions Model
### Definition of the Functional Solutions Model:

>The functional solutions model of disability is a practical perspective that identifies the limitations (or "functional impairments") due to disability, with the intent to create and promote solutions to overcome those limitations. The primary task is to eliminate, or at least reduce, the impact of the functional limitations of the body through technological or methodological innovation. The pragmatism of the functional solution model deemphasizes the sociopolitical aspects of disability, and instead prioritizes inventiveness and entrepreneurship.

### Strengths of the Functional Solutions Model:

The strongest aspect of this model is that it is results-oriented. It seeks to provide solutions to real-world challenges, while sidestepping the often convoluted sociopolitical implications of disability within society.
 
### Weaknesses of the Functional Solutions Model:
When new technologies are involved, profit-driven entrepreneurs can sometimes miss the mark, creating products that may be innovative but not practical or useful, or which may be of more benefit to the innovators than to the target population, especially if the proposed solutions are expensive. Also, when the primary cause of a particular challenge is the socioeconomic circumstances in the environment, the functional solutions model's de-emphasis on socioeconomic issues can cause would-be innovators to ignore the most important aspects of the original problem.

## 5.	Social Identity or Cultural Affiliation Model
### Definition of the Social Identity or Cultural Affiliation Model:

>The social identity or cultural affiliation model refers to a sense of deriving one's personal identity from membership within a group of like-minded individuals. This model is most evident among people who are deaf, because of their shared linguistic experience as sign language users. Deaf culture and identity owes much of its strength to the somewhat exclusive nature of being a part of a close-knit linguistic minority.
Other people with disabilities may also feel a sense of belonging to a community with common life experiences and interests.

### Strengths of the Social Identity or Cultural Affiliation Model:

The social identity or cultural affiliation model accepts the person's disability completely, and uses it as a point of pride in being associated with other people in a similar condition.

### Weaknesses of the Social Identity or Cultural Affiliation Model:

Sometimes the sense of belonging felt by one group of people is counterbalanced by a sense of exclusion and not belonging by people who don't quite fit the group's expectations.

### Resources of the Social Identity or Cultural Affiliation Model:

## 6.	Charity Model
### Definition of the Charity Model:

The charity model regards people with disabilities as unfortunate and in need of assistance from the outside, with those providing charity viewed as benevolent contributors to a needy population.
 
### Strengths of the Charity Model:
The charity model can inspire people to contribute their time and/or resources to provide assistance when it is genuinely needed.

### Weaknesses of the Charity Model:

The charity model can be condescending toward people with disabilities, who may come to resent the feeling that they are the object of pity by other people, and that they must depend on accepting or cultivating this pity on a continual basis. The charity model often focuses on short-term, immediate needs, often at the expense of more comprehensive, and ultimately more effective, long-term solutions.
