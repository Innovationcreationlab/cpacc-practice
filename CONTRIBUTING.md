# How to submit questions
You may submit questions in one of three ways:
## 1. By submitting an issue with your question

Submit a [proposed question issue](https://github.com/robfentress/cpacc-practice/issues/new?assignees=&labels=proposed+question&template=proposed-question.md&title=%5BQUESTION%5D). The requirements for the question are as follows:

* It should be a multiple choice question 
  * with four possible answers and 
  * only one correct answer.  
* It should be written in [GIFT format](https://docs.moodle.org/37/en/GIFT_format#Multiple_choice).  Please use the [GIFT Question Editor](https://fuhrmanator.github.io/GIFT-grammar-PEG.js/docs/editor/editor.html) to validate that your question can be parsed correctly before submitting.
* It should not include a title

Precede your questions with comments that include:
* The numbered _"study task"_ listed in the [Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies Body of Knowledge](https://iaap.membershipsoftware.org/files/IAAP%20CPACC%20BOK%202017_062317.docx) that your question relates to.  If there is no study task, include the section of the CPACC your question relates to.
* A reference to any source materials you are basing the question on

***

An example submission would be something like this:

### Question
```
// Study Task: I:A.1 Characterize and differentiate between theoretical models of disability, including the strengths and weaknesses of their underlying assumptions

// Sources: 
//   The [Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies Body of Knowledge](https://iaap.membershipsoftware.org/files/IAAP%20CPACC%20BOK%202017_062317.docx)

What is a strength of the medical model of disability?
{
  =It defines disability in a way that facilitates treatment of the individual by the medical profession.
  ~It emphasizes the responsibility of society for creating enabling conditions for all people.
  ~It encourages individuals to view themselves as a class with common interests, so they can more effectively advocate for their rights.
  ~It encourages empathy for those with disabilities.
}
```
## 2. By forking repository and submitting a pull request

## 3. If a contributor, by creating a branch and submitting a pull request

If you are regularly submitting questions, you can request to be added as a contributor.  As a contributor, you won't have to fork the project.  Rather, you can just create a branch in the base repository and make a pull request from that branch.  Also, as a contributor, you'll be able to make comments on other's pull requests to help in the peer review of questions.  Just open a [contributor request issue](https://github.com/robfentress/cpacc-practice/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=contributor-request.md&title=).
